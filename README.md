ðŸš¨ Fraud Detection System

Overview

This system provides a comprehensive fraud detection solution with a Streamlit dashboard and FastAPI backends for real-time and batch prediction, as well as fraud reporting capabilities.
Components
1. Streamlit Dashboard (streamlit_app.py)
A user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and interacting with the fraud detection system.

Features:

Real-time transaction monitoring
Historical data visualization
Fraud statistics and metrics
Filter transactions by date, payer, payee, or transaction ID
Integration with batch processing API
Real-time fraud prediction
Fraud reporting capability

2. Batch Fraud Detection API (batch_api.py)
Processes multiple transactions in a single request.
Endpoints:

POST /batch-fraud-detection: Analyzes multiple transactions for fraud patterns

3. Real-Time Fraud Detection API (realtime_api.py)
Provides immediate fraud analysis for individual transactions.
Endpoints:

POST /real-time-fraud-detection: Checks if a single transaction is fraudulent

4. Fraud Reporting API (reporting_api.py)
Handles user-reported fraud cases.
Endpoints:

POST /report-fraud: Submit a fraud report
GET /fraud-reports: Retrieve all reported frauds

5. Data Generation Script (generate_data.py)
Creates sample transaction data for testing and demonstration.
